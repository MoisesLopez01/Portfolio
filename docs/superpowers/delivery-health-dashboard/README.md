# Delivery Health Dashboard

A standalone Google Apps Script (GAS) web app for delivery leadership (directs and above). It
answers *what percentage of available delivery hours is logged as billable client work?* —
delivery labor is mostly fixed cost, so each utilization point moves gross margin directly.

Four tiles, one per metrics-dictionary metric, each with a 6-week trend sparkline and RAG color:

1. **Billable Utilization** — billable ÷ available capacity for the last completed week (companion:
   `tracked/capacity`).
2. **On-Time Delivery Rate** — resolved-by-due-date ÷ resolved-with-due-date over **non-epic**
   delivery issues, computed live from `Jira Raw` (companion: n resolved with a Due Date).
3. **Forecast Accuracy** — `1 − |actual − estimate| ÷ estimate` averaged over resolved epics that
   carry both an estimate and logged time (companion: measurability coverage + which direction the
   variance runs).
4. **Quality / Rework** — **placeholder** tile, muted "data pending — reopen/CSAT feed not yet
   connected". No numbers until the reopen/CSAT feeds exist (spec §11).

Below the tiles: a **people × weeks grid** (2 completed + current + 3 future weeks), collapsed to
capacity hours tinted by billable utilization, or expandable per-week into stacked bars
(billable / non-billable / idle / OOO) with a click-through accordion of the underlying stats.

Region chips + Team dropdown + person search scope the tiles, trends, and grid together.

Spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-delivery-health-dashboard-design.md`](../specs/2026-07-31-delivery-health-dashboard-design.md).

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `Code.js` | GAS server — `doGet()` (access-gated) serves the HTML; `getDeliveryData(forceRefresh)` reads Capacity/Tracked/Planned/NS Billable/PH/Jira Raw + Roster by spreadsheet ID, builds the person × week + Jira-bucket model, returns JSON. `buildDeliveryModel_()` is the full compute, shared by the cache-first endpoint and the `warmDeliveryCache()` 30-min trigger (`setupDeliveryCacheWarmer()` installs it). `probeDeliverySources()` and `auditJiraFillRates()` are one-time post-deploy diagnostics. 13 `_test_*` unit tests. |
| `Security.js` | Email allowlist (admin / viewer / open-access) — `SEC_DH`, `checkDeliveryAccess()`, `getDeliveryAccessSettings()`, `saveDeliveryAccessSettings()`, `buildAccessDeniedPage_()`. Inherited from the demand dashboard's `Security.js` (itself inherited from `PS Security.js`). |
| `Dashboard.html` | Client — loads cache-first via `google.script.run.getDeliveryData(false)`; ↻ Refresh forces a live read; renders tiles + grid; 🔒 Access panel (admins); per-panel ⬇ Save PNG. |
| `node-tests.js` | Local Node runner for the pure `_test_` functions in `Code.js` (stubs `Logger`/`Utilities`/cache) — `node node-tests.js`. Not pasted into the GAS project. |

## Data sources

Seven tabs across two spreadsheets. All IDs live in the `CONFIG_DH` block in `Code.js` and can be
overridden via Script Properties without touching code.

| Source | Spreadsheet | Tab | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capacity | Tempo hours SS (`SOURCE_SS_ID`) | `Capacity Tempo` | Per-person scheduled hours per ISO week; fallback 38h (ANZ) / 40h (else) when a person/week cell is missing |
| Tracked | same | `Tempo Tracked Time` | Tracked hours per person-week (NETSUITE keys excluded); `Team` cell; `Key` for the Jira Region join |
| Planned | same | `Planned Time Tempo` | Planned hours per person-week (NETSUITE excluded); NETSUITE rows = PTO **fallback** only |
| PTO | PTO accumulation workbook (`DH_PTO_SS_ID` override; same source as the PS Dashboard's PTO metric) | `Accumulation Cost` | **Primary PTO source**: dated Usage/Time Off transactions per Employee Number → weekly hours (`CONFIG_DH.PTO_UNIT` — verify hours-vs-days via `probeDeliverySources()`); unreadable → NETSUITE-row fallback, labeled in `meta.ptoSource` |
| Billable | same | `NS Billable` | Daily rows (`Employee`, `Total Billable Hours`, `Non-Billable Hours`, `Date`, …) bucketed to ISO weeks. Supplies the billable **mix** only — hour counts come from Tempo |
| Holidays | same | `PH` | `Date \| Location \| Holiday` → per-person holiday hours by fuzzy location match |
| Jira | same | `Jira Raw` | `Region` (col 32) and `Team` (col 33) per issue, dedup'd on `Key` (the tab holds one row per issue *per week bucket* and `Jira Backlog.js` rewrites it whole on every export, so duplicates differ only in the week label — any row is equivalent); On-Time Delivery (`Due Date`, `Resolution Date`, non-epics only) and Forecast Accuracy (`Original Estimate (sec)`, `Time Spent (sec)`, epic type) |
| Roster | Roster SS (`ROSTER_SS_ID`) | `Data` + `Contractors Data` | Population gate — active, Class = Professional Services (Class check skipped for crew) / Department = Services; `Key Location` drives the ANZ capacity fallback and the person-region fallback |

Both spreadsheet IDs are overridable via Script Properties:

```
DH_SOURCE_SS_ID   → overrides CONFIG_DH.SOURCE_SS_ID (Tempo hours + NS Billable + PH + Jira Raw)
DH_ROSTER_SS_ID   → overrides CONFIG_DH.ROSTER_SS_ID (Data + Contractors Data)
```

## Metric formulas

```
capacity   = Capacity Tempo hours; fallback 38h (ANZ) / 40h (else) if the cell is missing
pto        = Accumulation Cost usage hours that week (Employee Number join;
             NETSUITE rows from Planned Time Tempo as fallback)
holiday    = per-person PH hours (8h/day, 7.6h ANZ) minus already-booked NETSUITE hours
             that week, floored at 0 (a booked holiday is never double-counted)
available  = max(0, capacity − pto − holiday)
planned    = planned hours (non-NETSUITE)
tracked    = tracked hours (non-NETSUITE)
nsBillRaw  = NS Billable "Total Billable Hours" summed over the ISO week   (raw, diagnostic only)
nsNonBillRaw = NS Billable "Non-Billable Hours" summed over the ISO week   (raw, diagnostic only)
billShare  = nsBillRaw / (nsBillRaw + nsNonBillRaw)      — null when NS has no rows that week
nsCov      = NS classified this person-week (billShare exists)
billable   = tracked × billShare        — NS classifies, Tempo quantifies
nonBillable= tracked × (1 − billShare)
unclassified = tracked − trackedCov     — tracked hours in NS-uncovered weeks
availCov   = available, but only for NS-classified person-weeks

billableUtil = billable / availCov      (Utilization tile headline)
trackedUtil  = tracked / available      (Utilization tile companion)
onTime       = resolved ≤ Due Date ÷ resolved-with-Due-Date, per week          (On-Time Delivery tile)
               over NON-EPIC issues only
forecastAcc  = avg(1 − |Time Spent − Original Estimate| / Original Estimate)   (Forecast Accuracy tile,
               over resolved epics with a non-zero estimate AND non-zero logged
               time; negative accuracy floored at 0)
rework       = placeholder — no formula yet (reopen/CSAT feeds don't exist)
```

### Metric caveats (read before quoting a number)

- **On-Time scope is a policy switch — `CONFIG_DH.ONTIME_SCOPE`.** Before 2026-08-03 the rate mixed
  every resolved issue type together, which is the one reading nobody wants: an epic's Due Date is a
  programme milestone set by the PM and its resolution trails its last child, so epics and
  Stories/Tasks measure different lifecycles — and epics' much lower Due-Date fill rate also inflated
  the coverage denominator, making hygiene look like a delivery miss.

  | Value | Covers | Use when |
  |---|---|---|
  | `"delivery"` *(shipped default)* | non-epic issues — Stories/Tasks | the rate should mean "did the team hit its own commitments" |
  | `"epic"` | epics only | the Metrics Dictionary reading — milestone-level client commitments |
  | `"all"` | every resolved issue | comparison with the pre-2026-08-03 number only |

  **Known deviation from the dictionary (user decision 2026-08-03).** The Metrics Dictionary
  (owner: Bill) asks for Epic/Milestone or Client-Commitment-labelled items — i.e. `"epic"`. We ship
  `"delivery"` deliberately: it's the rate a delivery manager can act on. Raise it with Bill as a
  *dictionary* question rather than switching silently. The tile names its own scope (`N of M
  resolved issues had a due date ⓘ`) so the number can't be misread either way. Changing the switch
  changes the metric's meaning: bump `DH_SCHEMA_VER_` and run `bustDeliveryCache_()`.
- **On-Time ≠ SLA compliance.** "On time" means *resolved on or before the Jira Due Date*, which the
  PM sets. For Managed Services engagements the contractual SLA date can differ. Contractual SLA
  compliance is a separate metric and is **not** measured here.
- **Forecast Accuracy skips zero-worklog epics.** A closed epic with an estimate but no logged time
  used to score 0% — the worst possible accuracy — so Jira time-tracking hygiene (time logged on the
  children only) was being reported as a forecasting failure. Nothing is measurable there, so it now
  counts toward coverage only and the card states the count.
- **Forecast variance has a direction.** Accuracy alone reads identically whether a team over-runs or
  closes early. The card splits the *lost accuracy points* (not the epic count, so one 3× over-run
  outweighs three near-misses) into over-run vs under-run.
- **Utilization divides by AVAILABLE hours, not gross capacity.** PTO and public holidays come out of
  the denominator, so approved absence never dilutes the rate — but a high % can sit on a much
  smaller base. The card states the base (`Xh available of Yh capacity — Zh PTO/holiday removed`).
- **Backlog "est. remaining" is Jira-sourced.** `Original Estimate − Time Spent`, both from
  `Jira Raw`. Tempo is the authoritative time source, so an issue whose hours went into Tempo but
  never mirrored into Jira reads as more remaining work than there is. Planning signal, not a
  committed number.
- **NetSuite classifies, Tempo quantifies — the split is a ratio, not a pair of hour counts.**
  Tempo tracks every hour worked but cannot say which are billable; NetSuite knows the
  billable/non-billable mix. So the NS mix is applied as a **proportion of the Tempo tracked total**:
  `billable = tracked × billShare`. Two consequences worth knowing:
  - `billable + nonBillable === tracked` **by construction**, so `billableUtil` can never exceed
    `trackedUtil`. Before 2026-08-03 the dashboard carried NS *absolute* hours over a Tempo
    denominator, and because the feeds are independent nothing bounded the numerator — a person with
    20h tracked and 32h NS-billable reported 80% utilization on 20h of logged work. That inflation
    reached the hero tile, the trend sparkline, the ▲/▼ delta, every rollup, and the grid tint.
  - The mix is **extrapolated** over the whole tracked total. Where NS captured only part of a
    tracked week, the classified portion's mix is assumed to represent the rest. That is the intended
    model, but it *is* an assumption, so the drill-down states the two feed totals side by side
    whenever they differ by more than 0.5h and names the share being applied.
- **A person-week NetSuite never classified is `unclassified`, not 0% billable.** It keeps its tracked
  hours (so `trackedUtil` is unaffected) but leaves **both** sides of the billable rate — its
  availability is excluded from the denominator via `availCov`. Otherwise an export that lags or
  covers a shorter window than the trend would paint real zeros, and the sparkline would show a ramp
  that is pure coverage. These hours get their own hatched bar segment and their own legend entry.
- **Check `meta.nsCoverage` before quoting the utilization number.** It reports classified
  person-weeks, `classifiedPct` of tracked hours, the `gapHours` reconciliation total between the two
  feeds, and any NS employee names no roster alias resolved (`unmatchedRows` / `unmatchedNames`) —
  an unresolved name classifies nothing, which used to look exactly like a person who billed nothing.
  The Utilization card shows a `⚠ classification covers N% of tracked hours` line below 99%.

`NS Billable` unreadable → the Utilization tile falls back to `tracked/capacity` with a "billable
data unavailable" chip; the grid still renders. `Jira Raw` unreadable → On-Time Delivery and
Forecast Accuracy show "Jira data unavailable"; Utilization and the grid are unaffected. Roster
unreadable is the one **fatal** error (population and Region can't be derived without it).

## Region lens

The standard region for every tile is the **issue-level Jira `Region` field** (`Jira Raw` col 32,
decided 2026-07-31, superseding an earlier Roster-Key-Location-only design):

- **Jira tiles** (On-Time Delivery, Forecast Accuracy) group directly by each issue's `Region`.
- **Person-level Region** (Utilization tile + grid) = the region receiving the **majority of that
  person's tracked hours** in the trend window — tracked rows carry an issue `Key`, joined to
  `Jira Raw`'s `Region` for that `Key`. Ties break alphabetically (deterministic).
- **Roster fallback:** a person with no region-tagged tracked hours falls back to their Roster
  `Key Location` bucket (`CONFIG_DH.LOCATION_REGION_MAP`, unmapped locations → `Other`). Their row
  in the grid carries a **◦ marker** next to the name (tooltip: "region from roster location (no
  region-tagged work)") so a roster-derived region is never silently presented as Jira-sourced.

## Team filter semantics

Filter values are the **individual Tempo teams** — the `Team` column on Tracked/Planned rows is
pipe-joined (`"Team A | Team B"`); `splitTeams_()` splits, trims, and dedupes into the dropdown's
individual options (plus "All"). A person matches a team filter by **membership**: someone on
`Team A | Team B` appears under either selection, contributing their **full** hours to each.
Consequently **team rates do not sum to the All total** — this is by design (utilization is a
rate, not an additive count) and is called out in the dashboard's ⓘ note under the tiles.

## Access control (`Security.js`)

Same three-layer model as the other GAS dashboards in this repo (`SEC_DH`), scoped to delivery
leadership — no manager org-tree scoping:

- **Bootstrap admin** (`SEC_DH.BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN`) — always Admin, not removable via the UI.
- **Default admins / viewers** (`SEC_DH.DEFAULT_ADMINS` / `DEFAULT_VIEWERS`) — code-level, always
  active. Edit these for permanent leadership stakeholders.
- **Runtime admins / viewers** — Script Properties `DH_DASH_ADMINS` / `DH_DASH_VIEWERS`
  (comma-separated), additive on top of the defaults. Managed from the dashboard's **🔒 Access**
  button (admins only) → add/remove emails, toggle Open Access, Save. Backed by
  `getDeliveryAccessSettings()` / `saveDeliveryAccessSettings()`.
- **Open access** — `SEC_DH.OPEN_ACCESS_DEFAULT` (default `false`) or `DH_DASH_OPEN_ACCESS`. Set
  `true` only for an all-hands/demo, then flip back — a stored property overrides the code
  default, so check the 🔒 panel if access ever seems too open.

Enforced **server-side** in both `doGet()` (denied users get a minimal "access restricted" page)
and `getDeliveryData()` (returns an error model) — defense in depth, never client-only.

## Export window (why the period views have the depth they do)

Every period view is capped by the export behind it, so the four exporters and this
dashboard share **one dial**: `EXPORT_HISTORY_WEEKS` in `TempoPlanExport.js` (**52**), mirrored by
`CONFIG_DH.WEEKS_PAST_DEEP`. Before 2026-08-03 each exporter had its own fixed anchor date, which
meant three separate problems: the windows grew by a week every week (so trigger runtime crept up
until an export would eventually time out), `TempoPlanExport`'s `TO_DATE` was a hard `2026-12-31`
stop that would have exported nothing from 2027, and the depth on offer (10–18 weeks) was well short
of what Monthly and Quarterly need. All four are now **rolling** — derived from today, bounded, and
Monday-aligned by construction.

A period only counts toward a trend when it is **complete**, and a window's oldest period is always
truncated — so usable depth is *not* `weeks / 13`. Measured worst case (running in the last week of
a quarter, `_test_periods_` guards this):

| `WEEKS_PAST_DEEP` | Complete quarters | Complete months | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | **1** | 6 | Quarterly unusable — one data point, no trend, no vs-prior delta |
| **52** | **3** | 11 | **current** — every period view has a real trend |
| 65 | 4 | 14 | Full-year / quarter-vs-same-quarter-last-year |

Stopped at 52 rather than 65 deliberately: 52 weeks of one person's worklogs still fits inside
Tempo's single 500-result page, so the Tempo exports stay at **one request per person**. 65 tips
typical users onto a second page, doubling request count and with it the transient-500 exposure
those exports already retry around.

**Cost is flat in weeks for three of the four**, which is why the jump from 30 was affordable there:
`TempoTrackedTime` and `TempoCapacityTime` paginate *per user* over the whole range, and
`Jira Backlog.js` does **one** broad JQL and buckets by resolution date client-side (each issue
resolves once, so it lands in exactly one week bucket — rows track issue count, never weeks × issues).

⚠️ **`TempoPlanExport.js` was the exception** — its pass 2 (`groupPlansByWeekScoped_`) needs per-week
accuracy and so issues one request per **(week × user)**, O(weeks × users). Pointing its *fetch*
window at 52 weeks produced **10,532 requests and an ~18-minute run** (66 weeks × 228 users), against
~7,300 at the old 32-week window.

**Fixed with freeze-and-merge (2026-08-03), the same pattern `TempoCapacityTime.js` uses.** A
completed week's plan is *history and never changes*, so the sheet is the system of record for it and
each run only week-scope-fetches a small refresh window:

```
fetch window  = REFRESH_PAST_WEEKS (2) + current + FUTURE_WEEKS (5) = 8 weeks
sheet window  = RETAIN_HISTORY_WEEKS = the shared dial (52 weeks)
```

| | requests | est. run | planned history |
|---|---|---|---|
| 52-wk full rebuild (the 18-min run) | 10,532 | ~18 min | 4 quarters |
| 18-wk full rebuild (interim) | ~3,830 | ~6.5 min | ~1 quarter |
| **8-wk refresh + merge (now)** | **~1,277** | **~2 min** | **3 quarters** |

So it is **3× cheaper than the interim fix and 8× cheaper than the run that started this**, while
finally carrying the same depth as the other three. History depth is now free, so
`RETAIN_HISTORY_WEEKS` tracks the shared dial like everything else.

- **Freeze rule:** weeks outside the refresh window keep their stored value untouched. Weeks inside
  it are *fully replaced* — absent from the fetch means **0**, so a plan deleted in Tempo actually
  disappears instead of lingering. Rows missing from the fetch keep their frozen history.
- **`backfillPlanHistory()`** is the one-time manual fill for a new sheet, or after the dial is
  raised. It widens the fetch window to the full retention depth for a single run (~16 min) and is
  deliberately **not** on a trigger. Normal runs never pay that cost again. The run logs a reminder
  when it finds no stored history.
- All existing integrity checks (pass-1/pass-2 parity, the person-parity repair) still operate on the
  one fetch window, so they compare like with like exactly as before; frozen history sits outside
  their scope.
- A pre-flight projection logs the worst-case request count *before* fetching, with a
  `WEEK_SCOPED_WARN_REQUESTS` guard — 10,532 requests should be visible in the first seconds of a
  run, not inferred from a log line minutes in.

Two Jira-side details worth knowing:
- `Jira Backlog.js` keeps **two** windows. `RAW_HISTORY_WEEKS` (52) drives `Jira Raw`, which the
  dashboards read; `WEEKS_BACK` (4) still drives the `Exec Q&A` WoW sheet, which is one column per
  week and has no reader for deep history. Both are cut from the same single fetch.
- `EPIC_EXPAND_WEEKS` (13) bounds epic expansion, the one part of that export whose cost *does*
  multiply (each epic fans out to its child tree). Children of programmes closed 10 months ago
  added rows nobody reads. **This is a behaviour change** — expansion previously followed the whole
  window. Raise it if a consumer needs older trees, and watch the row count.

### Changing the depth
Order matters — **exports first, dashboard second.** If the dashboard asks for weeks the exports
don't carry, those weeks come back empty and render as *zero activity*, not as missing data.
1. Raise `EXPORT_HISTORY_WEEKS` in `TempoPlanExport.js`.
2. Re-run the exports once by hand: `fetchTempoLoggedTime`, `fetchTempoCapacity`,
   `runJiraEpicTracker`, then **`backfillPlanHistory()`** (not `fetchTempoPlannedTime` — the normal
   run only refreshes 8 weeks and would leave the newly-requested older columns empty). Capacity is
   merge-based too, so a deepened floor triggers one deep re-fetch and then converges back to the
   cheap forward-only path. Budget ~16 min for the plan backfill; the rest are minutes.
3. Raise `CONFIG_DH.WEEKS_PAST_DEEP` to match, bump `DH_SCHEMA_VER_`, redeploy, `warmDeliveryCache()`.
4. Check `previewWeekWindows()` (Jira) and `probeDeliverySources()` agree on the span.

## Cache

`getDeliveryData()` caches its JSON response in `CacheService.getScriptCache()` via
`cachePutLarge_()` / `cacheGetLarge_()`: the JSON is gzipped and split into 90 KB chunks
(`<key>_0..n` + `<key>_meta`), because CacheService rejects any single value over 100 KB. A
missing chunk on read is a clean cache miss (recompute), never an error. TTL is
`CONFIG_DH.CACHE_TTL_SEC` (65 min).

Cache key: `dh_v<DH_CACHE_VER>` — `DH_CACHE_VER` is a Script Property (default `1`).
`bustDeliveryCache_()` bumps it, stranding the prior-version entry (CacheService can't enumerate
keys, so versioning is how a model-shape change takes effect immediately). Run it manually from
the GAS editor after any change to the model's shape.

Second, independent guard: every payload is stamped with `DH_SCHEMA_VER_` (**currently 5**) and
`getDeliveryData()` treats a cached model with a different stamp as a clean miss. **Bump
`DH_SCHEMA_VER_` on any payload-shape change** — a new/renamed field, a re-keyed bucket — so a
deploy can never serve a stale-shaped entry even if nobody remembers to bust the cache.

| Schema | Change |
|---|---|
| 4 | PTO read from Accumulation Cost (`meta.ptoSource`) |
| 5 | On-Time excludes epics; forecast buckets gain `nNoTime` / `nOver` / `nUnder` / `lossOver` / `lossUnder` and skip zero-worklog epics |
| 6 | `WEEKS_PAST_DEEP` 30 → 52. Shape unchanged, but a cached v5 model holds only 34 weeks of `people[].weeks`, so the Quarterly view would render its older quarters empty — which reads as zero activity, not missing data |
| 7 | `billable` / `nonBillable` are the NS mix applied as a **ratio** to Tempo tracked hours, not NS absolute hours. Adds `nsCov` / `availCov` / `trackedCov` / `billShare` / `nsBillRaw` / `nsNonBillRaw` per week + `meta.nsCoverage`. **Must** force a rebuild — a cached v6 model would keep serving the inflated absolutes against the wrong denominator |

**Warmer:** `warmDeliveryCache()` runs on a time trigger (install once with
`setupDeliveryCacheWarmer()` in the GAS editor as the owner; interval =
`CONFIG_DH.CACHE_WARM_EVERY_MIN`, 30 min), so loads are warm most of the time. Data can lag sheet
edits by up to the warm interval — the ↻ Refresh button (`loadData(true)`) always bypasses cache
for a live read. Error models are never cached.

## Deploy
1. script.google.com → New project (separate from all existing dashboards).
2. Add files: `Code` (Code.js), `Security` (Security.js), HTML file named `Dashboard` (Dashboard.html — name must match doGet).
3. Run `node node-tests.js` locally — all suites must pass before pasting.
4. In the GAS editor run `probeDeliverySources()` — verify every source logs a row count,
   the NS sample Employee name format, and NS→roster join coverage >90%. Then check
   `meta.nsCoverage` on a built model: `unmatchedRows` should be ~0 (each unresolved NS employee
   classifies nothing), and `classifiedPct` is the share of tracked hours the billable rate
   actually describes — if it is low, fix the NS export window or the name join before
   quoting utilization at all. Also check the
   "Jira Region distinct values" line: every value must match the chip vocabulary
   (AMER / EMEA / APAC / ANZ / Other) — a ⚠️ there means the region chips would filter
   to empty; map or rename the offending values before trusting region filters.
5. Run `auditJiraFillRates()` — record Due Date / Original Estimate / Region / Team fill rates
   (spec §10.5). Low fill ⇒ adjust tile so-what wording, not the design.
6. Run `getDeliveryData` once → grant scopes (account must open BOTH spreadsheets).
7. Deploy → New deployment → Web app → Execute as Me → "Anyone within ServiceRocket with the link".
8. Run `setupDeliveryCacheWarmer()` once as the owner.
9. After any model-shape change: run `bustDeliveryCache_()` then ↻ Refresh.

## Manual QA (after deploy)
- [ ] Tiles show numbers for the last completed week; Rework tile is muted "data pending".
- [ ] Region chips + Team dropdown + search all filter tiles AND grid together.
- [ ] Collapsed past/current cells tinted; future cells neutral; capacity hours correct (32/38/40).
- [ ] Click a week header → stacked bars; ⚠ appears when planned or tracked > capacity.
- [ ] Click a bar → accordion with 4 stats + bullet lines; multiple accordions can be open.
- [ ] A known PTO week shows OOO hatch and reduced available hours.
- [ ] **Billable Utilization is ≤ the tracked/capacity companion on every filter combination.**
      Billable above tracked is now arithmetically impossible — if you see it, the payload is a
      stale pre-v7 cache: run `bustDeliveryCache_()` then ↻ Refresh.
- [ ] In an accordion, `TRACKED Xh — b … / nb … / unclassified …` adds up to X.
- [ ] A person-week with no NetSuite rows shows **no tint**, an `unclassified` hatched bar segment,
      and a `tracked/capacity · unclassified` header — never `0% billable util`.
- [ ] Where the NS and Tempo totals differ, the accordion shows the `ⓘ NS totals Xh vs tracked Yh`
      line naming the applied share (this is the extrapolation being disclosed, not a bug).
- [ ] The Utilization card shows `⚠ classification covers N% of tracked hours` whenever N < 99.
- [ ] CSV export: `Billable h + Non-billable h + Unclassified h == Tracked h` on every row.
- [ ] 🔒 Access panel loads/saves for admins; a non-listed account gets the denied page.
- [ ] ↻ Refresh forces a live read (check generatedAt changes).
- [ ] On-Time coverage reads lower than before schema 5 (epics no longer in the denominator) and the
      rate moves — expected, not a regression. Sanity-check the new `n` against a Jira JQL count of
      resolved non-epic issues in that week.
- [ ] Forecast card shows the variance-direction line (`X% of the variance is over-run …`) whenever
      there is measurable variance, and a `N with no logged time` note when zero-worklog epics exist.
- [ ] Utilization card shows the base line (`Xh available of Yh capacity — Zh PTO/holiday removed`)
      in any period containing PTO or a public holiday.
- [ ] ⬇ CSV downloads and opens in Excel with the BOM intact (blob path); no console error.

## Save PNG

Both the tiles row and the grid panel have their own **⬇ PNG** button — each exports just that
element as `delivery-health-<tiles|grid>-<headlineIso>.png`. The first click lazy-loads
`html2canvas` from a pinned CDN (`H2C_URL`); if the GAS sandbox blocks the script, an alert fires
("PNG export unavailable (script blocked)") and the dashboard is otherwise unaffected.

## Notes

- **Security deviation from the original brief:** the 🔒 Access panel's `s.admins`, `s.viewers`,
  and `s.bootstrapAdmin` values are interpolated into HTML `value=`/text attributes. Since these
  are attacker-influenceable strings (admins can paste arbitrary email-like text into the
  allowlist), every interpolation is wrapped in the existing `esc_()` HTML-escaping helper rather
  than concatenated raw, closing a stored-XSS path an admin (or a compromised admin account) could
  otherwise open against every other admin who opens the panel.
- Ramp-up exclusion and FTE-vs-crew toggle are **not** implemented here — population is Roster
  active FTE + crew together (spec §12, backlog item).
- No manager org-tree scoping — this is delivery leadership data with an explicit allowlist.
